CondaError: Run 'conda init' before 'conda activate'

[W ProcessGroupNCCL.cpp:1569] Rank 0 using best-guess GPU 0 to perform barrier as devices used by this process are currently unknown. This can potentially cause a hang if this rank to GPU mapping is incorrect.Specify device_ids in barrier() to force use of a particular device.

/home/ashmal/anaconda3/envs/cvs_ass2_dino/lib/python3.7/site-packages/torch/_tensor.py:575: UserWarning: floor_divide is deprecated, and will be removed in a future version of pytorch. It currently rounds toward 0 (like the 'trunc' function NOT 'floor'). This results in incorrect rounding for negative values.
To keep the current behavior, use torch.div(a, b, rounding_mode='trunc'), or for actual floor division, use torch.div(a, b, rounding_mode='floor'). (Triggered internally at  /opt/conda/conda-bld/pytorch_1623448265233/work/aten/src/ATen/native/BinaryOps.cpp:467.)
